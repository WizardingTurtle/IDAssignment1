# ARMA X Website
[linktowebsite]([https://wizardingturtle.github.io/IDAssignment1/html/index.html])
## Project Overview
This project is a website that advertises, informs and sells a fictional game by a fictional company

## Design Process
I wanted the website to have little jumps to other pages as possible and so I decided on 4 main pages.

- home page: where the main product is advertised and the purchasing options are located

- Gameplay page: where the description of the game is shown with the following game footage

- Roadmap page: where updates on the game are shown + news feed from the devs are streamed

- products: where past projects and products are on display for the user to click on and view (and maybe even buy)

all pages will share the same universal navbar for ease of navigation and will each have a sign up for mail at the bottom.

## Website Main User Features
### Existing features
- Learn more about the game through text, videos and photos
- Pre-order the advertised game
- View the developers' future plans for the game and latest news
- See past work done by the company
- Sign up for news letters
- Sticky top navigation bar
- email address verification (for news letter and pre-ordering)
